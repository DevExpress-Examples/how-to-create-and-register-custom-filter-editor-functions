# WinForms Filter Editor - Create and register custom functions

This example creates three custom functions:

* **NotBeginsWith** - a function opposite to the standard *BeginsWith* function.
* **IsDaysInterval** - checks whether a record belongs to the *‚Äú(Today - N days) ~ (Today + N days)‚Äù* timeframe.
* **IsWeekend** - shows only Saturday and Sunday records.

The example demonstrates three methods (techniques) for registering custom functions (depending on the registration type you are using, feature availability may vary):

* Handle the control's `QueryCustomFunctions` event - custom functions added on this event are available for this specific UI control only.
* Handle the `CriteriaOperator.QueryCustomFunctions` event to register global custom functions available for all Filter/FilterEditor controls in the application.
* Use the `DevExpress.Data.Filtering.CustomFunction` attribute in a data source class - a custom function registered by this attribute is available for all Filter/FilterEditor controls that are bound to this data source.
